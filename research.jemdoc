== Research and Projects

== Overview
Currently, the goal of my research is to develop and improve machine learning and optimization approaches and apply them to probabilistic trajectory prediction, object tracking, decision making and motion planning tasks for intelligent systems such as autonomous vehicles and robotics.

The methodologies mainly cover Bayesian theories, probabilistic graphical models, deep learning, (inverse) reinforcement learning as well as computer vision techniques.
